# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

## Example Contributions

You can contribute in many ways, for example:

-   [Report bugs](#report-bugs)
-   [Fix Bugs](#fix-bugs)
-   [Implement Features](#implement-features)
-   [Write Documentation](#write-documentation)
-   [Submit Feedback](#submit-feedback)

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/taxprofiler/taxpasta/issues.

**If you are reporting a bug, please follow the template guidelines. The more
detailed your report, the easier and thus faster we can help you.**

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything labelled with `bug` and `help wanted` is open to whoever wants to implement it. When you decide to work on
such an issue, please [assign yourself to
it](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users)
and add a comment that you'll be working on that, too. If you see another issue
without the `help wanted` label, just post a comment, the maintainers are
usually happy for any support that they can get.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything labelled with
`enhancement` and `help wanted` is open to whoever wants to implement it. As for
[fixing bugs](#fix-bugs), please [assign yourself to the
issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users)
and add a comment that you'll be working on that, too. If another enhancement
catches your fancy, but it doesn't have the `help wanted` label, just post a
comment, the maintainers are usually happy for any support that they can get.

### Write Documentation

TAXPASTA could always use more documentation, whether as
part of the official documentation, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog
posts, articles, and such. Just [open an issue](https://github.com/taxprofiler/taxpasta/issues) to let us know what you will be working on
so that we can provide you with guidance.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/taxprofiler/taxpasta/issues. If your feedback fits the format of one of
the issue templates, please use that. Remember that this is a volunteer-driven
project and everybody has limited time.

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up TAXPASTA for
local development.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project makes use of [PEP-735
> `dependency-groups`](https://peps.python.org/pep-0735/) which are only
> supported in versions of hatch [greater than
> v1.16.0](https://hatch.pypa.io/dev/blog/2025/11/24/hatch-v1160/#dependency-groups).
> To see which version of hatch you have installed use `hatch --version`, and
> to update hatch use [`hatch self
update`](https://hatch.pypa.io/dev/cli/reference/#hatch-self-update) or whatever
> method is suitable for your installation.

1. Fork the https://github.com/taxprofiler/taxpasta
   repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/taxpasta.git
    ```

3. [Install hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/) `> 1.16`.

4. Create a branch for local development using the default branch (typically `main`)
   as a starting
   point. Use `fix` or `feat` as a prefix for your branch name.

    ```shell
    git checkout main
    git checkout -b fix-name-of-your-bugfix
    ```

    Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, apply the quality assurance tools and check
   that your changes pass our test suite. This is all included with in hatch
   environments

    ```shell
    hatch run style:check
    hatch run types:check
    hatch run tests:run
    ```

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub. Please use [semantic
   commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

    ```shell
    git add .
    git commit -m "fix: summarize your changes"
    git push -u origin fix-name-of-your-bugfix
    ```

7. Open the link displayed in the message when pushing your new branch in order
   to submit a pull request.

### Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your
   new functionality into a function with a docstring.
3. Your pull request will automatically be checked by the full test suite.
   It needs to pass all of them before it can be considered for merging.
