# TAXPASTA Documentation

_TAXonomic Profile Aggregation and STAndardisation_

## About

The main purpose of taxpasta is to _standardise_ taxonomic profiles created by a range of
bioinformatics tools. We call those tools taxonomic profilers. Taxpasta can not only
standardise profiles but also _merge_ them across samples for the same profiler. In future,
we also intend to offer methods for forming a _consensus_ for the same sample analyzed by
different profilers.

### Supported Taxonomic Profilers

Taxpasta currently supports standardisation and generation of comparable
taxonomic tables for:

-   [Bracken](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/bracken/)
-   [Centrifuge](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge/)
-   [DIAMOND](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond)
-   [Kaiju](https://kaiju.binf.ku.dk/)
-   [Kraken2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/)
-   [KrakenUniq](https://github.com/fbreitwieser/krakenuniq)
-   [MALT](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/algorithms-in-bioinformatics/software/malt/)
-   [MetaPhlAn](https://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/tools/metaphlan/index.html)
-   [mOTUs](https://motu-tool.org/)

See [supported profilers](supported_profilers/index) for more information.

## Install

It's as simple as:

```shell
pip install taxpasta
```

## Usage

The main entry point for taxpasta is its command-line interface (CLI). You can interactively
explore the offered commands through the help system.

```shell
taxpasta -h
```

Taxpasta currently offers three commands corresponding to the main [use-cases](#about).
You can find out more in the [ commands documentation ](commands/index.md).
