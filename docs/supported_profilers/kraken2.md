# Kraken2

Kraken2 is a taxonomic classification system using exact k-mer matches to achieve high accuracy and fast classification speeds. This classifier matches each k-mer within a query sequence to the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes containing the given k-mer.

An output file with tab-delimited fields as described [here](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/blob/master/docs/MANUAL.markdown#standard-kraken-output-format) is accepted by `taxpasta`.
