!!! warning

    In particular, when comparing results between various tools, please be very
    aware of their differences.  In the document on
    [terminology](terminology.md), we describe how we think about the different
    tools. Spending some time on considering the consequences now, will save
    you a lot of headache and prevent potentially wrong results later.
